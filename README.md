# MICROBLAZE_UART_DEMO_ON_CMOD_ARTIX-A7
This Project includes step-by-step guide for running a uart demo on the Microblaze soft core processor from AMD(Xilinx) on CMOD ARTIX-A7 FPGA .
before getting started , make sure you are having the following the below requirements-:
1. Xilinx VIVADO (could be any version -preferably later than 2019.2)
2. Xilinx VITIS  (remember , this has to be same as the vivado verison)..
   (instead of downloading Xilinx VIVADO , just install Xilinx VITIS tool , in which there you can select Vivado to be pre-installed )...
3. CMOD-ARTIX-A7 FPGA ( you can have any other from ARTIX family , or maybe spartan-7 , but then you have to select the same)
4. USB-cable

  if you are done all of the those , then let's go ahead .... 

1. Launch VIVADO
